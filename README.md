# PrepWise.AI – MBA Mock Interview Portal

This repository contains the PrepWise.AI hackathon project: an Azure OpenAI-powered platform that parses a candidate’s resume/essays, generates a personalized MBA interview loop, records video responses, and delivers instant AI feedback with a downloadable PDF report.

The full application lives inside the `prepwise` Next.js workspace. See `prepwise/README.md` for detailed setup instructions, architecture notes, and deployment guidance.
